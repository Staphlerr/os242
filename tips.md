# TIPS
* Follow the instructions properly, step by step. Don't skip any, and don't add anything.
* If you don't understand the assignments, ask a friend or made a forum on scele. GSGS (Google Sana Google Sini) is also needed!
* Don't forget to study for the quiz.
* If you are mentioned on ATTN forum, please fixed directly, or your weekly score will be low.
